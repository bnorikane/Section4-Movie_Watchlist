# Section 4: Movie Watchlist and Relational Data

We have now learned about the fundamentals of SQL and how to interact with databases using Python's sqlite3 module. In this section, we'll learn some more SQL syntax and focus on working with relational data.

As part of this, we will learn about primary and foreign keys, JOINs, and atomicity.

The project we'll be building in this section is a movie watchlist app. By the end of this section we'll have a project that allows users to:

- Keep track of movies they're interested in and their release dates.
- Store the movies a user has seen out of all movies in the database.
- Add a new user to keep track of their watched movies.

This multi-user support will really help us learn about relational data!
